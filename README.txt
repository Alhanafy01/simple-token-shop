This project implements a basic token and token shop system on the blockchain, utilizing the following concepts:

    ERC20 Tokens: The project creates a custom ERC20 token that can be bought and sold.
    Oracles: The project uses Chainlink Data Feeds to retrieve reliable off-chain data, potentially for determining token prices. (Optional: Specify the data being retrieved if applicable)
    Token Shop: Users can interact with the token shop to purchase the ERC20 token using native currency (e.g., ETH).

Learning Source:

This code was developed based on learnings from the Chainlink Bootcamp 2024.

Project Structure:

    The main contract files are:
        Token.sol: Defines the ERC20 token behavior.
        TokenShop.sol: Handles token purchase functionality and interacts with the Token contract and potentially Chainlink Data Feeds.
    Additional files might be present for helper functions or configuration (depending on your implementation).

Running the Project:

    Prerequisites:
        A local development environment like Remix IDE or a full node setup (e.g., Ganache).
        Basic understanding of Solidity and ERC20 standards.
        (Optional, if using Chainlink Data Feeds) Familiarity with Chainlink oracles and data feed integration.

    Deployment:
        Deploy the Token.sol contract first.
        During deployment of TokenShop.sol, provide the address of the deployed Token contract.
        (Optional) If using Chainlink Data Feeds, configure the address of the appropriate data feed in the TokenShop.sol constructor.

    Interaction:
        Use your development environment's functionality to interact with the deployed contracts and purchase tokens.

Disclaimer:

This is a basic project designed for learning purposes. Thorough security audits and testing are essential before deploying such a project on a mainnet.

Further Development:

    Implement additional features for the token shop (e.g., selling, setting prices).
    Integrate more complex functionalities using Chainlink Data Feeds (e.g., dynamic pricing based on external data).
